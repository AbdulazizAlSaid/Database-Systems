Queries:

1. Finds all players who played panthon and group by region order by damage
SELECT Player.player_name, 
       Region.region_name, 
       Player_Match_Stats.team_id, 
       Player_Match_Stats.team_name, 
       Player_Match_Stats.team_position, 
       Player_Match_Stats.kills, 
       Player_Match_Stats.deaths, 
       Player_Match_Stats.assists, 
       Player_Match_Stats.gold_earned, 
       Player_Match_Stats.damage_dealt, 
       Player_Match_Stats.objective_damage_dealt, 
       Player_Match_Stats.minions_killed, 
       Player_Match_Stats.neutral_minions_killed
FROM Player_Match_Stats
JOIN Champion ON Player_Match_Stats.champion_id = Champion.champion_id
JOIN Player ON Player_Match_Stats.puuid = Player.puuid
JOIN Region ON Player.region_id = Region.region_id
WHERE Champion.champion_name = 'Pantheon'
ORDER BY Player_Match_Stats.damage_dealt DESC;

----------------------------------
2.  TAKES PLAYERS AND ORDERS BY LP
SELECT 
  p.player_name, 
  r.region_name, 
  p.league_points, 
  SUM(p.wins + p.losses) AS total_games_played,
  SUM(p.wins) AS total_wins,
  SUM(p.losses) AS total_losses
FROM 
  Player p 
  JOIN Region r ON p.region_id = r.region_id 
GROUP BY 
  p.player_name, 
  r.region_name, 
  p.league_points 
ORDER BY 
  p.league_points DESC;

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.TAKES PLAYERS AND ORDER BY WINS
SELECT 
  p.player_name, 
  r.region_name, 
  p.league_points, 
  SUM(p.wins) AS total_wins,
  SUM(p.losses) AS total_losses 
FROM 
  Player p 
  JOIN Region r ON p.region_id = r.region_id 
GROUP BY 
  p.player_name, 
  r.region_name, 
  p.league_points 
ORDER BY 
  total_wins DESC;

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Takes top 100 players by LP and counts which regions theyre from
SELECT 
  r.region_name, 
  COUNT(*) AS player_count 
FROM 
  (SELECT * FROM Player ORDER BY league_points DESC LIMIT 100) p 
  JOIN Region r ON p.region_id = r.region_id 
GROUP BY 
  r.region_name;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Same as above but just sorts by wins instead
SELECT 
  r.region_name, 
  COUNT(*) AS player_count 
FROM 
  (SELECT * FROM Player ORDER BY wins DESC LIMIT 100) p 
  JOIN Region r ON p.region_id = r.region_id 
GROUP BY 
  r.region_name;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Takes average player stats across all games and orders them by LP
SELECT p.player_name, p.league_points, 
    AVG(pms.kills) AS avg_kills, 
    AVG(pms.deaths) AS avg_deaths, 
    AVG(pms.assists) AS avg_assists, 
    AVG(pms.damage_dealt) AS avg_damage_dealt, 
    AVG(pms.minions_killed) AS avg_minions_killed, 
    AVG(pms.gold_earned) AS avg_gold_earned, 
    AVG(pms.objective_damage_dealt) AS avg_objective_damage_dealt 
FROM Player p 
INNER JOIN Player_Match_Stats pms 
    ON p.puuid = pms.puuid 
GROUP BY p.player_name, p.league_points 
ORDER BY p.league_points DESC;
